# Project idea
We are creating an improved digital platform for RCE Saskatchewan to enhance the visibility, accessibility, and engagement of SDG-focused projects for the Saskatchewan community. The platform will feature categorization of projects based by location and SDG, data visualization tools, making it easier to discover, support, and collaborate on sustainability projects efficiently.

# Project background
Sustainable development is essential for creating a better future, but many communities face challenges in accessing, implementing, and educating people about Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)-based projects. While many projects align with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), they frequently lack recognition, collaboration, and funding to scale their impact. Numerous exciting sustainability projects have been developed within different communities, but they are unable to realize their full potential due to limited resources and connections by the community members. Additionally, educating communities about their community projects can raise awareness, inspire participation, and encourage further innovation with individuals expertise. By identifying these SDG-focused projects inside a community and directly engaging with project owners can foster partnerships, provide possible funding opportunities, and drive change.

The need of bridging these gaps between projects and community could empower local and global sustainability efforts, ensuring that project solutions receive the support and recognition they need to create a long lasting impact.

# Business Need
Regional Centres of Expertise (RCE) Saskatchewan is committed to promoting education for sustainable development within the Saskatchewan community and globally. However, to reach their goal's full potential, they require additional support modification to the current process. Currently, RCE recognizes and awards the best SDG-focused projects by showcasing the winners on their website. However, these projects are displayed in a static list format with limited information about the project and project owners. Additionally, the website lacks essential features such as filtering options for awards and categorization of SDG projects. There is no data to visualize components to save searching time. These limitations of the website hinder potential knowledge-sharing, collaboration, awareness, funding and meaningful engagement for these projects. Therefore, there is an opportunity to address these issues to enhance accessibility, improve visibility for projects, enable collaboration with project owners, ultimately driving greater change within the sustainability community.
